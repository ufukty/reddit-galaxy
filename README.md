-   Edges (links of the network) are representing all of the hyperlinks which posted in a subreddit and points to another subreddit.

-   Orange end of each link represents the source subreddit, and blue end represents the target.

-   Orangish subreddits have lots of outgoing hyperlinks. Blueish subreddits have lots of incoming hyperlinks. Albescent subs has both incoming and outgoing hyperlinks in large amount.

-   Links are weighted and weights are the number of total post between two subs. Weights are represented by opacity in the image. Minimum opacity is 0.02

-   There are 54.075 subreddits and 571.927 posts/hyperlinks in dataset and 234.792 weighted links were drawn.

-   Locations are randomly assigned and only the top 600 most-linked and top 400 most-linker subs are labeled.

-   I needed to increase the visibility of blue edges because they are more distributed than orange ends and was suppressed by orange areas.
